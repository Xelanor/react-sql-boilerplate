# Summary

This project will use;

- React
- Node.js
- MongoDB (Mongoose)
- Express

This project consists two folders which are client and server.
Dependencies will be installed seperately into these two directories

## SERVER (Backend)

```
npm install --save express cors mongoose dotenv concurrently
```

```
npm install -g nodemon
```

#### In order to run the server

```
nodemon server
```

## Database

### Mongoose Implementation

MongoDB Atlas is used

#### `Paste your connection string into server/.env`

### Models

All database schemas will go in models folder.

User model is created with one field `username`

### Server API Endpoints

We need API routes to perform CRUD operations.

Created `routes` folder and `users` route.

In `server.js` the route is imported and used as a middleware.

## CLIENT (Frontend)

```
npm install --save react-router-dom concurrently
```

## Connect Client to Server

```
npm install --save axios
```

We use `Concurrently` to run both server and client at the save time but just for **development**.

While in the client folder;

```
npm run dev
```

# React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
